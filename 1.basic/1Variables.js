//  A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.

// 4 type of variables declarations. 
/*
    let – is a modern variable declaration.
    var – is an old-school variable declaration. Normally we don’t use it at all, but we’ll cover subtle differences from let in the chapter The old "var", just in case you need them.
    const – is like let, but the value of the variable can’t be changed.
